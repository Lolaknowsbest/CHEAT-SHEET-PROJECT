# CHEAT-SHEET-PROJECT
A cheatsheet on type of selectors mostly used in CSS and how to use them

I used HTML for the skeleton and copy on the page. Then I used CSS to style them. 
During this project I faced a few issues that stregthened my knowledge of CSS. One of the issues was that my styling failed to apply to the HTML no matter what selector I used. 
This project taught me the importance of debugging with strategy. 
I really enjoyed creating this project because I learnt how to use CSS selectors.
I encourage anyone having issues with CSS selectors to use this cheatsheet to guide their understanding. 
Thank you for reading this README :)
